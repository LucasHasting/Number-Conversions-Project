# Number Conversions Project

This program converts any base n number to a base m number where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 36 and both n and m are integers. It uses logarithms to convert from base 10 to any base and it uses exponents to convert from any base to base 10.

## Program-Overview

The [base-converter.py](https://github.com/LucasHasting/Number-Conversions-Project/blob/main/base-converter.py) file contains the main driver of the program and is what needs to be executed, the [data.py](https://github.com/LucasHasting/Number-Conversions-Project/blob/main/data.py) file contains the dictionaries used in the source_functions.py file. Finnaly, the [source_functions.py](https://github.com/LucasHasting/Number-Conversions-Project/blob/main/source_functions.py) file contains all the functions used in the driver.
