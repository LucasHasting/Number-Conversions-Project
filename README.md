# Number Conversions Project
This repository holds a small side project that converts any base n number to a base m number where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 36 and both n and m are integers.

It uses logarithms to convert from base 10 to any base and it uses exponents to convert from any base to base 10.

All the files are needed, the main file to execute is base-converter.py, make sure all files are in the same directory.
